To the grader:

I wasn't able to get the teapot fully loaded. I attempted and put a
significant amount of effort into the MP, trying a lot of different
things from replies from my peers, but in the end by the due date I
wasn't able to get it to load. I tried to start some terrain, although
that clearly didn't work as well as I had hoped either. 

I understand that this MP is work a significant portion of my grade,
and so I was wondering if there was something that could be done to
help salvage my grade in some way; if possible, I would really appreciate it.

If you could look at my code and potentially offer *some* partial credit
for trying, I would greatly appreciate it. Regarding the teapot loading,
I definitely missed some crucial step somewhere, although I wasn't able to
figure it out by the due date. Please forgive me for my incompetence and I 
appreciate your understanding.
